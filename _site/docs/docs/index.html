<h1 id="welcome-to-the-leaspy-software">Welcome to the Leaspy software</h1>

<p>Leaspy, for Learning Spatiotemporal Pattern in Python, aims to describe the average and individual spatiotemporal trajectories of biological data.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-leaspy-do-for-you-">What can leaspy do for you ?</h2>
<p>With leaspy, you may from a longitudinal dataset :</p>

<p>-Estimate an average trajectory<br />
-Estimate individual parameters<br />
    -Personalize the model (e.g. reparametrize diagnostic time)<br />
    -Analysis of its parameters within a cohort (e.g. Male vs Female)<br />
    -Prediction its future evolution<br />
-(Work in progress) Synthetic patient/cohort simulation</p>
